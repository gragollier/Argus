# Argus
From the Greek `Argus Panoptes`, Argus is the monitoring service for my homelab. It monitors hosts states and more and alerts them to me using a variety of methods. As of now, this only monitors and reports issues, it does not store logs.

## Setup
All configuration lives in the `config.yaml` file. You can see the included example, `config.example.yaml` for help.
